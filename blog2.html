A designated small and comfortable room or space should be selected where your Savannah kitten can spend at least the first one to two weeks, until they are comfortable to explore additional parts of your home. Basic necessities such as food, water, and litter box are also needed. We always send your kitten home with a starter kit with sample food.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Please be aware of the scammers offering kittens for ridiculous amounts, you will pay at least $1,500 to $25,000 depending on the generation you are Interested in.<br>
                                    With thoughtful preparation, your Savannah kitten will have a great time and a good experience growing up with you.</span>
