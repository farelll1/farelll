                            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Savannah cats are a mesmerizing breed that blends the wild allure of the African serval with the domestic charm of a house cat. Their striking spotted coats, long legs, and large ears give them an unmistakable resemblance to their wild ancestors. But beyond their beauty, these cats boast an intelligent and playful nature, making them fascinating companions.</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Savannah cats are notable for their large, tall stature, which gives them a majestic presence. They are highly intelligent, curious, and active animals that require engagement and companionship. Their loyalty can be dog-like, often forming strong bonds with their families.</p>

                        <h2 id="history" class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">History & Origin of the Savannah Breed</h2>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">The Savannah cat breed originated in 1986 when a Bengal breeder crossed a male African serval with a domestic cat. The result was an elegant, hybrid feline with a unique temperament. Over the years, selective breeding has led to various generations, each with distinct physical and behavioral traits.</p>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Savannah cats are classified by their filial generation (F1, F2, F3, etc.), which indicates how many generations they are removed from their serval ancestor. F1 Savannahs have a high percentage of wild DNA, making them more exotic and energetic, while later generations (F3 and beyond) exhibit more domestic tendencies.</p>
                        <div class="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-primary p-4 my-6 rounded-r-lg">
                            <p class="italic text-gray-700">"The first documented Savannah cat was born in April 1986 when a female domestic cat gave birth to a kitten sired by a male serval. This pioneering hybrid was named "Savannah," which eventually became the name for the entire breed. Breeder Judee Frank was responsible for this initial crossing, though it was Patrick Kelley and Joyce Sroufe who developed a breeding program and worked to establish the Savannah as a recognized breed."</p>
                            <p class="font-medium mt-2 text-gray-800">— Judee Frank, Savannah Cat Creator</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Recognized by the International Cat Association (TICA) in 2001, Savannahs quickly gained popularity for their exotic looks and dynamic personalities. With each generation, breeders have worked to perfect the balance between wild instincts and domestic sociability, leading to a breed well-adapted to home life yet retaining a glimpse of its wild ancestry.</p>

                        <p class="mb-6">One of the most defining features of Savannah cats is their distinctive coat pattern, typically golden with black spots, similar to a cheetah. Their lean, muscular bodies and long legs make them one of the tallest domestic cat breeds. Their large, expressive ears are another signature feature, contributing to their exotic appearance.<br> An adult Savannah can weigh between 12 to 25 pounds, with males generally being larger than females. Their impressive jumping ability and height make them standout athletes of the cat world.</p>

                                <p class="text-gray-700">The Savannah cat head is small in proportion to the body, with the face forming an equilateral triangle. The nose protrudes slightly and the muzzle is tapered with no break. Viewed in profile, the forehead appears straight to slightly convex, and also forms a triangle that extends from the top of the eye to the tip of the nose, then to the jawline and back up to the eye. The neck is long and lean.</p>
